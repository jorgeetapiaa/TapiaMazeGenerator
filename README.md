# TapiaMazeGenerator
Maze starts off as a grid of cells.
File uses recursion to see which cells have been visited. 
If the cell has not been visited, it will visit the cell and remove the "wall" that separated the adjacent cells. 
Recursion continues until a maze with only one possible solution is created. 


This project was an assignment from my university. The MazeGenerator file was provided, as well as the myMazeGenerator header file. My input was the myMazeGenerator.cpp file.
